ddrbin_param.txt:
start tag: keep default value. Do not modify it.
ddr2_freq: ddr2 frequency,  unit:MHz.
lp2_freq: lpddr2 frequency,  unit:MHz.
ddr3_freq: ddr3 frequency,  unit:MHz.
lp3_freq: lpddr3 frequency,  unit:MHz.
ddr4_freq: ddr4 frequency,  unit:MHz.
lp4_freq: lpddr4 frequency,  unit:MHz.
lp4x_freq: lpddr4x frequency,  unit:MHz.

If ddr*_freq/lp*_freq is no value, it's frequency will keep the same with the ddr bin frequency.

uart id: uart number. 0 for uart0, 1 for uart1, 2 for uart2..., 0xf will disable uart.
uart iomux: uart iomux info, 0 for uartn_m0, 1 for uartn_m1, 2 for uartn_m2...(like uart2_m0, uart2_m1,uart2_m2),
Or 1 for uartn_a, 2 for uartn_b, 3 for uartn_c.(like uar2a, uart2b, uart2c).
uart baudrate: uart baudrate should be 115200 or 1500000.

If uart id/iomux/baudrate is no value, uart info will keep the same with ddr bin config.

ddr_2t: ddr 2T timing mode. 1: enable ddr 2T, 0: disable ddr 2T.
If 'ddr_2t' is no value, ddr_2t info will keep the same with ddr bin config.

ddr2_f1_freq_mhz: ddr2 frequency number 1,  unit:MHz.
ddr2_f2_freq_mhz: ddr2 frequency number 2,  unit:MHz.
ddr2_f3_freq_mhz: ddr2 frequency number 3,  unit:MHz.
ddr2_f4_freq_mhz: ddr2 frequency number 4,  unit:MHz.
ddr2_f5_freq_mhz: ddr2 frequency number 5,  unit:MHz.
...
ddr*_f*_freq_mhz/lp*_f*_freq_mhz: Only RV1126/RV1109 used.The program will initialize dram by following order for example: ddr4_freq, ddr4_f1_freq_mhz, ddr4_f2_freq_mhz, ddr4_f3_freq_mhz, ddr4_f4_freq_mhz, ddr4_f5_freq_mhz.
And the final frequency is ddr4_freq to boot system.
The ddr frequency table in kernel dts/dtsi file need correspond to these frequencies.

These parameters are about Spread Spectrum Modulator(ssmod) for PLL.
ssmod_downspread: ssmod work mode. 0: down spread, 1: center spread.
ssmod_div: Divider required to set the modulation frequency. RK3308 suggests to ssmod_div=2, others platforms suggest to ssmod_div=5.
ssmod_spread: spread amplitude % = 0.1 * ssmod_spread; 0: disable ssmod, others will enable ssmod, max to 0x1f.
